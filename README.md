## How to Get Your Code onto GitHub

This editor has a built-in feature to make this easy. Please follow these steps exactly.

### Step 1: Open the "Source Control" Panel

On the far left of your editor window, you will see a vertical bar of icons. The third icon from the top looks like a road splitting into two paths. **Click this icon.**

This will open the **Source Control** panel.

### Step 2: Write a "Commit Message"

At the very top of the Source Control panel, you will see a text input box. It is right above a blue button and says "Message" inside it. **Click inside this box and type a message.**

A good message is: `Initial project commit`

### Step 3: "Commit" the Files

After you have typed your message in the box, **click the blue "Commit" button** that is right below it. This saves a snapshot of your project.

### Step 4: "Publish" to GitHub

After you commit, a new button will appear called **Publish Branch**. **Click this button.**

This will upload your code. You may be asked to sign in to GitHub and choose a name for your repository. Please choose to make it a **Public** repository so you can share it.
